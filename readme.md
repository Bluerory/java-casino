# Java Casino  

## About  
I started this project during the autonomous learning period at BeCode to learn Java basics and practice OOP.  
The "Java Casino" is a command-line program where the user can insert money in a slot-machine and wish to win!  

#### Language  
Java

## Things I learned  
- How to create and configure a Java project with Intellij
- What a strongly typed language is (in practice, compared to JS, PHP and Python)
- I tried to use more methods, for reusability.
- Java basics such as:
    - the use of OOP in a real project,
    - the visibility and types of variables and methods,
    - working with a single file per class,
    - the use of the Scanner class.
    
## Steps
1) I created the menu, with test methods to try and call them using a scanner.
2) I made 2 new classes: Player and Machine, and added basic methods I could call from the menu.
3) Made the game functional: user can bet, play and get money back if they're lucky (numbers displayed are 
   randomized and user must get 2 identical digits to win so it's pure luck).
4) Created a greeting message taking user's name and the amount of money they want to add to their account.
5) Created and ArrayList containing ell created users since program launch.
6) New menu: 
   - possibility to switch user accounts or create a new player,
   - some options will not show up until the player created their account.
